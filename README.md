# Autosomal Recessive Genetic Calculator

This React-based web application calculates the genetic probabilities for autosomal recessive traits. Input the probability of parent carriers and visualize the outcomes for their offspring being normal, carriers, or affected.

## Features

- Calculate probabilities of offspring being normal, carriers, or affected.
- Input parent carrier probability as a percentage or fraction.
- Visualize the outcomes using a pie chart.
- Detailed calculations and explanations provided.
